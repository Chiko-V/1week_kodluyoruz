            <p>A strong core looks good, but it's about more than that-a stable and strong core makes daily 
                tasks a lot easier and safer. Not to mention, it gets you through dynamic workouts (like 
                running, kickboxing, and
                weightlifting) injury-free. Toning your abs and burning fat are just the bonus effects. These 
                core moves are perfect for beginners-or advanced athletes who want to bang out some extra sets.
                </p>
            <p>It's true: Big weights build big muscles, especially when you're talking about your glutes and 
                abs. That said, you can still get a pretty damn good abs and butt workout with just a 
                resistance band, medicine ball, and single dumbbell (all of which you buy for cheap on Amazon 
                and can keep right at home).</p>
            <p>This diverse group of exercises (including our fave, the Lemon Squeezer Exercise) targets your 
                entire core to help you sculpt a flatter belly. Better yet, you can group them together for 
                maximum payoff in just five minutes-which is way better than cranking out sit-ups for the same 
                mount of time. Just check out our 30-Day Ab Challenge for ideas on how to mix and match the moves. We abs-
                olutely guarantee it. (Want more? We challenge you to a Plank-Off!)

            <p>Time Needed: 35 minutes
                Equipment: A medicine ball, single dumbbell, and a mini resistance band
                Target Zone: Lower body and abs
            </p>
            <p>Instructions: Complete 10 reps for each move, then immediately
            continue to the next exercise. Once you've finished all five moves, repeat
            the circuit over from the beginning. Do a total of three rounds. To build strength, I recommend 
            doing this routine one or two times a week, and warming up with a few dynamic stretches first.
            </p>
            <p>Pro tip for getting the most out of these lower-abs exercises: Focusing on the activation of your 
                re is the key to success with these moves (and any abs exercise). In fact, one study from Hull 
                University found that people who mentally focused on their muscles and how they were moving 
                experienced greater muscle activity, which can result in greater strength gains over time. We've 
                included "mind your muscle" tips with every exercise to help you maximize your results.</p>
            <p>Not only will you build a lot of strength, but you're going to get your heart rate pumping and break 
                 major sweat. By the end, your entire body is going to feel the burn-it's not going to be easy, but 
                 I know you can do it. Let's jump in...
            </p>
            <h3>Squat Press </h3>
            <h4>How to:</h4>
            <p>A. Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, holding medicine ball in front of chest. 
            Hinge at hips and bend knees, lowering into a squat while keeping medicine ball in the same position.</p>
            <p>B. Extend legs while simultaneously pressing medicine ball directly overhead. Reverse the movement and 
                repeat the sequence. Do 3 to 4 sets of 15 reps.</p>
            <h4>What it works:</h4>
            <p>Core, shoulders, legs, and butt</p>

            <h3>Plank Up Downs</h3>
            <h4>How to: </h4>
            <p>A. Get in a plank position with hands and feet shoulder-width apart and abs engaged.
            </p>
            <p>B. Quickly bend left arm and lower down onto left forearm. Repeat with right arm. Immediately place 
                left hand under shoulder and straighten left arm, pressing body up. Repeat with right arm to return to 
                ank position. Do 4 to 5 sets of 10 reps.
            </p>
            <h4>What it works:</h4>
            <p>Core, arms, abs</p>

            <h3>Wall Pivot Slams</h3>
            <h4>How to: </h4>
            <p>A. Stand with your feet just outside shoulder-width apart, toes turned slightly out. Squat down with your 
                weight in your heels, proud chest, knees tracking over toes, and a neutral spine. When you hit the bottom 
                your squat, squeeze your butt tight and drive hard through your legs and heels as you launch straight up. 
                That's one rep.</p>
            <h4>What it works:</h4>
            <p>Glutes, arms, abs</p>
